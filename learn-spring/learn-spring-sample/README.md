Bean factory implementations should support the standard bean lifecycle interfaces as far as possible. The full set of initialization methods and their standard order is:
1. BeanNameAware's setBeanName
2. BeanClassLoaderAware's setBeanClassLoader
3. BeanFactoryAware's setBeanFactory
4. EnvironmentAware's setEnvironment
5. EmbeddedValueResolverAware's setEmbeddedValueResolver
6. ResourceLoaderAware's setResourceLoader (only applicable when running in an application context)
7. ApplicationEventPublisherAware's setApplicationEventPublisher (only applicable when running in an application context)
8. MessageSourceAware's setMessageSource (only applicable when running in an application context)
9. ApplicationContextAware's setApplicationContext (only applicable when running in an application context)
10. ServletContextAware's setServletContext (only applicable when running in a web application context)
11. postProcessBeforeInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors
12. InitializingBean's afterPropertiesSet
13. a custom init-method definition
14. postProcessAfterInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On shutdown of a bean factory, the following lifecycle methods apply:
1. postProcessBeforeDestruction methods of DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessors
2. DisposableBean's destroy
3. a custom destroy-method definition
